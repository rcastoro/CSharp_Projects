This is a solution I created as a timesheet solution for employers that can be used by employees to track timesheets, send timesheet email to specificed emails or upload timesheets to a google drive account. The application is sophisticated because the client doesn't itself contain any of the programs functionality; that is returned from the server (host) using Windows Communication Foundation and RESTful web calls. This makes updates to the core functionality of the program a simple push to the one host service that runs on a web server and all clients that are registered across the world will have access too all those new beneficial updates instantaneously without having to update their client software. This Host/Client setup also makes this program VERY accessible to any platform that can make web calls, phones, computers, tvs... Only a new client for the user experience need be developed.

This solution is to be used with a database to store appropriate entrees such as employee timesheets, hours, notes, employees, etc.. I do not have time now to setup schema scripts for a database for git but it's not difficult.
